Start of paragraph. Quantum physics is a branch of physics that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level. It describes the peculiar behavior of particles such as electrons, photons, and atoms, which do not follow classical physics laws. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical framework for describing the probabilities of various outcomes of a measurement of a quantum system, rather than definite outcomes. This strange behavior is often described by the principles of superposition and entanglement, where a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and two particles can become entangled, so that the state of one particle affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Quantum physics has led to the development of many new technologies, including the transistor, the laser, and quantum computers, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum physics is based on a set of mathematical rules known as quantum mechanics. These rules describe the behavior of particles and systems at the subatomic level. One of the key features of quantum mechanics is the concept of superposition. Superposition means that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, an electron can be in multiple energy states at once.  Quantum mechanics also introduces the concept of probability into physics. In classical physics, the outcome of an experiment is deterministic, meaning that it can be predicted with certainty. In quantum mechanics, the outcome of an experiment is probabilistic, meaning that it can only be predicted with a certain probability. End of paragraph.
